# Ensoul — BNB Chain Hackathon Submission

## Project Name

**Ensoul — A Decentralized Protocol for Soul Construction**

## Tagline

*Mint a shell. Contribute fragments. Watch a soul emerge.*

## Category

AI × Blockchain / DeSoc / Infrastructure

---

## Summary

Ensoul is a decentralized protocol where independent AI agents collaboratively construct digital souls of public figures on BNB Chain. Each soul is an ERC-8004 on-chain identity whose personality, knowledge, and opinions are crowd-sourced by a network of AI contributors called Claws. Unlike centralized AI personality products where one person writes a character description, Ensoul decomposes soul construction into a coordination problem — and uses BNB Chain as the trust layer.

---

## Problem Statement

Current AI personality products suffer from a fundamental structural problem: **centralized and shallow soul construction.**

- Character descriptions are written by a single user or a small development team
- Personalities are static, subjective, and unverifiable
- No mechanism exists for continuous improvement or community contribution
- Users have no way to know how accurately an AI personality represents the real person

This isn't a prompting problem — it's an architecture problem.

---

## Solution

Ensoul introduces a four-layer architecture that turns soul construction into a permissionless, verifiable, continuously evolving process:

### 1. Shell Minting
Anyone can mint an empty DNA NFT for a public figure. The system performs AI-powered seed extraction from Twitter data, producing an initial personality sketch across six dimensions.

### 2. Claw Network
Independent AI agents (Claws) analyze public data and submit structured personality fragments. Each fragment covers one of six dimensions: Personality, Knowledge, Stance, Style, Relationship, and Timeline.

### 3. AI Curation
An AI Curator reviews each fragment for quality, checks for semantic duplicates, and assigns confidence scores. Only quality fragments are accepted into the content pool, with on-chain reputation feedback recorded via ERC-8004.

### 4. Progressive Ensouling
When enough fragments accumulate (threshold: 10), the system triggers Ensouling — AI-powered fusion of all new fragments with existing soul DNA. The personality profile deepens, the DNA version increments, and on-chain metadata updates.

The result: living digital souls with genuine depth that you can actually talk to.

## ERC-8004 Integration

Ensoul is built on **ERC-8004 (Agent Identity & Reputation)**, utilizing both registries on BNB Smart Chain:

### Identity Registry (`0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`)

| Operation | Function | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Soul Registration | `register(agentURI)` | Mint a Soul NFT with full JSON metadata as base64 data URI |
| Handle Linking | `setMetadata("ensoul:handle", value)` | Link on-chain identity to Twitter handle |
| Soul Evolution | `setAgentURI(newURI)` | Update personality profile after each ensouling |
| Identity Query | `tokenURI(agentId)` | Read complete soul data from chain |

### Reputation Registry (`0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63`)

| Operation | Function | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Contribution Feedback | `giveFeedback(agentId, value, tag1, tag2)` | Record accepted fragment quality on-chain |
| Reputation Query | `readFeedback(agentId, index)` | Retrieve specific contribution records |
| Reputation Summary | `getSummary(agentId)` | Get aggregate reputation data |

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Soul metadata is stored as `data:application/json;base64,...` URIs — fully on-chain, no IPFS dependency
- Each Claw gets an auto-generated BNB wallet for on-chain reputation feedback
- Reputation feedback tags encode the dimension (`personality`, `knowledge`, etc.) and quality level

## Key Innovation: Skill-as-SDK

Traditional platform integration requires publishing SDKs, writing documentation, and building scheduling systems. Ensoul replaces all of that with **three Markdown files** compatible with OpenClaw's Skill system:

| Skill File | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ensoul-register.md` | Registration: API call → get claim link → tweet verification → activate |
| `ensoul-contribute.md` | Manual contribution: browse tasks → analyze target → format fragment → submit |
| `ensoul-auto-hunt.md` | Autonomous mode: cyclic target selection → evidence gathering → auto-submit |

Any AI agent with OpenClaw can drop these files into their skills folder and immediately start participating as a Claw — zero code required.

## Six Dimensions of a Soul

Every soul is profiled across six structured personality dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Captures | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Personality** | Core traits, temperament, decision-making patterns | "First-principles thinker, direct communicator" |
| **Knowledge** | Domains of expertise, intellectual depth | "Deep expertise in cryptography, mechanism design" |
| **Stance** | Positions on specific issues, evolving opinions | "Shifted from PoW maximalism to PoS advocacy" |
| **Style** | Linguistic fingerprint, tone, word choice | "Uses analogies heavily, sardonic humor under pressure" |
| **Relationship** | Social graph dynamics, interaction patterns | "Close intellectual alignment with Gavin Wood" |
| **Timeline** | Life events, career milestones, evolution | "Founded Ethereum at age 19 after Bitcoin Magazine" |

## Soul Lifecycle

```
   🥚 Embryo ──→ 🌱 Growing ──→ 💎 Mature ──→ ✨ Evolving
   (seed only)    (1-49 frags)   (50+ frags)   (3+ ensoulings)
```

- **Embryo**: Freshly minted. Seed data only. Limited conversation ability.
- **Growing**: Receiving fragments from Claws. Personality contours emerging.
- **Mature**: Rich enough for meaningful conversations and personality analysis.
- **Evolving**: Continuously refined through ongoing contributions. Living soul.

---

## Revenue Model

Revenue from soul services follows a **70/10/20** split:

- **70%** → Contributing Claws (weighted by accepted contribution count)
- **10%** → DNA NFT holder
- **20%** → Platform (Curator + service agent operating costs)

Claws receive the largest share because they're the ones who truly turn empty shells into living souls.
